# PURPOSE: This is a *hints* file to help guide students in creating the 
#          function get_pet_labels that creates the pet labels from the image's
#          filename. This function inputs: 
#           - The Image Folder as image_dir within get_pet_labels function and 
#             as in_arg.dir for the function call within the main function. 
#          This function creates and returns the results dictionary as results_dic
#          within get_pet_labels function and as results within main. 
#          The results_dic dictionary has a 'key' that's the image filename and
#          a 'value' that's a list. This list will contain the following item
#          at index 0 : pet image label (string).

# Imports python modules

# TODO 2: EDIT and ADD code BELOW to do the following that's stated in the 
#       comments below that start with "TODO: 2" for the get_pet_labels function 
#       Please be certain to replace None in the return statement with 
#       results_dic dictionary that you create with this function
#
